## Professional Work

### GuideWell Source

**_*Full Stack ReactJS & NodeJS Developer*_**

At GuideWell Source, I do many types of work, such as developing desktop, mobile, and web applications.

However, my work there is primarily focused on web development, and around the last 2 years I worked there, I have learned a lot about advanced React and NextJS.

Here are the details of the work I did at GuideWell:

- Created large scale single page application using ReactJS, Redux, Material UI, MongoDB, and NodeJS.
- Developed a few libraries of reusable react components (SideNav, TopNav, etc..) using life cycle methods and deployed into Artifactory. Currently, this package has been used by several projects in the entire organization.
- Initiated and re-designed the core modules of Customer Connect App using advanced JavaScript features like (ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9), ReactJS, Material UI, Styled-Components and Redux-thunk.
- Experience with Redux unidirectional data flow achieving the predictable application state behavior.
- Utilized the latest OOP design patterns with ReactJS, Redux, Babel, Webpack, and ES6 features for SPA development.
- Used React and Redux dev tools to understand the state, props changes and architectural flow of Higher Order Components (HOC) to debug the application.

### Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida

**_*Senior ReactJS Developer*_**

At Florida Blue, Customer-Connect project that helps service advocates to answer clients/customers with their benefits plans, claims, payments etc. I have developed 6 UI Screens and 8 micro services, and currently 7 of them are being used (every micro service has multiple api calls (for search, details, creating, updating). I also developed services that talk to the existing legacy systems (SOAP services) to integrate directly from Node server. The application begins with Google like search for customer search (using various criteria such as first name, last name, SSN, DOB, contract number etc). With full load data (4 million customers with 90 million claims documents) the average response time for each service call is 38 milli seconds. I have used Mongo indexing scheme efficiently to get these performance numbers.

Here are the details of the work I did at Florida Blue:

- Involved in building applications using ReactJS by building re-usable UI Components.
- Worked on Bootstrap, LESS to develop User Interface with responsive design.
- Involved in developing HTML, XML, and JavaScript for client-side presentation and data validation on the client-side within the forms.
- Developed dynamic responsive single page applications using Vue js.
- Involved in creating REST services using NodeJS, Express.JS, Mongoose, and Body-parser NPM modules.
- Created responsive layouts for mobile plot forms by creating a grid model using bootstrap.
- Worked on ReactJS for developing UI using Sorting, Pagination, and rendering for the search product page.
- Used AJAX to reduce the network load and update only the certain components of the website

## What They Say

- Krishna is an outstanding team member/developer to work with. As a member on the Scrum team he was pivotal in helping the team become the best it can be. Always willing to help, smart, and eager to learn. I would watch him take a complex ask or issue and solve it. Never said no to a challenge. There was nothing he couldn't do. I am truly honored to have worked with him as his scrum master.

- It’s rare to come across real talents who stand out like Krishna. I have been working with Krishna for about 2 years in a fast-paced environment at Florida Blue which involves developing/supporting a flagship application and collaborating with several teams.

  Krishna’s ability to understand the requirements and step up when the team needs him was unlike any I’ve seen before. He is a major contributor in driving the productivity level in our team.

  Whether it’s a hardship in production support or delivering product in tight deadlines, Krishna is the one I always counted on. Being a tech lead, I cannot imagine the team without his contributions and I hope we will continue working together on more exciting projects.

- Krishna is a hardworking, knowledgeable senior dev. Efficient with his work and very helpful to everyone on the team especially junior devs. Would highly recommend him to any team or company!
